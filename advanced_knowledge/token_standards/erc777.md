## ERC777

<br>

* an ERC20-compatible interface

* transfer tokens using a send function, similar to ether transfers

* compatible with ERC820 for token contract registration

* allow contracts and addresses to control which tokens they send through a tokensToSend function that is called prior to sending

* enable contracts and addresses to be notified of the tokens' receipt by calling a tokensReceived function in the recipient, and to reduce the probability of tokens being locked into contracts by requiring contracts to provide a tokensReceived function

* allow existing contracts to use proxy contracts for the `tokensToSend and `tokensReceived` functions

* operate in the same way whether sending to a contract or an EOA

* provide specific events for the minting and burning of tokens

* enable operators (trusted third parties, intended to be verified contracts) to move tokens on behalf of a token holder

* provide metadata on token transfer transactions in userData and operatorData fields

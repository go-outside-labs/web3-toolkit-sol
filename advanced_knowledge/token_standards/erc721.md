## ERC721

<br>


To see the difference between ERC20 and ERC721, look at the internal data structure used in ERC721:


```
mapping (uint256 => address) private deedOwner;
```

<br>

Whereas ERC20 tracks the balances that belong to each owner, with the owner being the primary key of the mapping, 
ERC721 tracks each deed ID and who owns it, with the deed ID being the primary key of the mapping.

### The ERC721 contract interface specification


```
interface ERC721 /* is ERC165 */ {
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _deedId);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved,
                   uint256 _deedId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator,
                         bool _approved);

    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 _balance);
    function ownerOf(uint256 _deedId) external view returns (address _owner);
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _deedId) external payable;
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _deedId)
        external payable;
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _deedId) external payable;
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, boolean _approved) payable;
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```
